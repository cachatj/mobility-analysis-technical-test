# A study of GPS mobility data

This project analyses GPS data gathered from Google Maps location history. 

Study of the person's habits and interests. Monitored preferred trajectories by adopting statistical methods and visualization techniques.

This repository contains raw location history data and a notebook for behavioral mobility assessment. The notebook loads, pre-processes, and performs feature engineering on the data. The project is several years old.

Scenario: You discovered this repository and believe it aligns with your data science team's goals. By replicating the original developer's work using your team's data, you aim to gain insights into what worked, what didn't, and gather knowledge to productionize the analysis at scale.

Given the advancements in tools and techniques since the developer's last commit 4 years ago, consider:
- Implementing contemporary methods to improve the tasks
- Suggesting better metrics or features that avoid the drawbacks of older measurements

Deliverables:
1. Submit a pull request with your revised notebook that successfully loads the provided raw data and runs without errors, recreating all graphics.
2. Be prepared to discuss the location history's implications about the tracked individual, providing timeline-anchored insights such as their living situation and work based on the data.
3. Critically evaluate the technical challenges overcome, the methodological merits of the approaches used, and the key takeaways from this project.
